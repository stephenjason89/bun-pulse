```
</details>

Ensure you have **Bun** installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, follow the [Bun installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/install).

## Usage

Setting up **BunPulse** is quick and easy. Here's how you can start your own WebSocket server compatible with the Pusher protocol.

### Basic Example

```typescript
import { startBunPulse } from 'bun-pulse'

// Starts BunPulse on a custom port (default: 6001)
const server = startBunPulse({ port: 7000 })
```

then `bun run your-file.ts` to start the server.

### Handling Events and Forwarding Messages

**BunPulse** forwards messages from your backend to clients connected via WebSockets. It doesn't manage subscriptions directly like Pusher, but instead relays events to subscribed clients using the Pusher protocol.

When your backend sends an event to **BunPulse**, it forwards the event to all clients subscribed to the specified channel. **BunPulse** also handles connection heartbeats and secure HMAC-based authentication.

### Message Forwarding

1. **Backend**: Your backend sends events to **BunPulse** via HTTP POST requests.
2. **BunPulse**: Forwards the events to all WebSocket clients subscribed to the specified channel.

#### Example: Event Broadcasting from Backend

```typescript
// Backend sends an event to BunPulse
// BunPulse forwards the event to all clients subscribed to 'my-channel'
server.publish('my-channel', {
	event: 'my-event',
	data: {
		message: 'Hello, world!'
	}
})
```

In this example:

- **Backend-Controlled Publishing**: The backend publishes events to channels, and **BunPulse** ensures that all clients subscribed to the specified channel (e.g., `my-channel`) receive the event.
- **No Direct Subscription Management**: **BunPulse** forwards events based on backend input; it does not manage channel subscriptions like Pusher.

> **Note**: If you're using **Laravel Lighthouse** or a similar backend for managing subscriptions, **BunPulse** will handle the message forwarding to WebSocket clients subscribed to the relevant channels.

### Sending Events to BunPulse from Your Backend

Your backend interacts with **BunPulse** by sending events via HTTP POST requests. The request body should follow the [Pusher protocol](https://pusher.com/docs/server_api_guide) format to ensure compatibility.

**BunPulse** expects the following data when receiving events:

- **`channel`**: The name of the channel to which the event will be published.
- **`name`**: The name of the event being published.
- **`data`**: The payload to send to the clients. This should be a JSON-encoded string.

```bash
POST http://localhost:6001/apps/:app_id/events
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

{
  "name": "my-event",
  "channel": "my-channel",
  "data": {
    "message": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

You can customize **BunPulse** by passing configuration options when starting the server. These options include:

- `port`: Specifies the port on which the WebSocket server listens (default: `6001`).
- `subscriptionVacancyUrl`: An optional URL to notify when a channel is vacated (i.e., no more subscribers).
- `heartbeatInterval`: The interval (in milliseconds) at which WebSocket heartbeat pings are sent to keep the connection alive (default: `25000`).
- `heartbeatTimeout`: The timeout (in milliseconds) after which an inactive WebSocket connection is closed (default: `60000`).

### Example with Custom Config:

```typescript
const server = startBunPulse({
	port: 7000,
	subscriptionVacancyUrl: 'https://myserver.com/api/subscriptions/webhook',
	heartbeatInterval: 20000, // Heartbeat every 20 seconds
	heartbeatTimeout: 50000 // Timeout after 50 seconds of inactivity
})
```

## Authentication

**BunPulse** uses HMAC SHA256 authentication to ensure secure WebSocket connections. When clients subscribe to a channel, they must provide a valid `auth` token, which is verified by the server to authenticate the connection.

### How Authentication Works

1. **Token Generation**:
    - On the client side, an `auth` token is generated by your backend using HMAC SHA256.
    - The token is created using the `socketId` (provided when the WebSocket connection is established) and the channel name that the client wants to subscribe to.
    - Your backend signs this data with the `PUSHER_APP_SECRET` and sends it back to the client.

2. **Token Verification**:
    - When a client attempts to subscribe to a channel, the `auth` token is sent to **BunPulse**.
    - **BunPulse** verifies the token by recalculating the HMAC using the `socketId` and channel, and comparing it with the token received from the client.
    - This ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to the channel.

### Setting up Pusher Authentication

To set up **BunPulse** with Pusher-style authentication, configure the following environment variables:

- `PUSHER_APP_KEY`: Your Pusher app key (used for client authentication).
- `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`: Your Pusher app secret (used for HMAC SHA256 signing).

Add these variables to your `.env` file or set them in your environment. Here's an example of the `.env` configuration:

```bash
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your-app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
```

### Example Backend Code for Generating the `auth` Token

Your backend should generate the `auth` token using HMAC SHA256. Here‚Äôs an example of how to generate the token:

```typescript
const crypto = require('node:crypto')

function generateAuthToken(socketId, channel, secret) {
	const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
	hmac.update(`${socketId}:${channel}`)
	return hmac.digest('hex')
}

// Example usage:
const authToken = generateAuthToken('socket-id', 'my-channel', process.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET)
```

### How BunPulse Verifies the Token

When the client subscribes to a channel, **BunPulse** uses the following logic to verify the `auth` token:

```typescript
function isAuthorized(socketId: string, data: WebSocketData): boolean {
	const expectedToken = generateHmacSHA256HexDigest(
		`${socketId}:${data.channel}`,
		String(import.meta.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET)
	)
	return data.auth === `${import.meta.env.PUSHER_APP_KEY}:${expectedToken}`
}
```

In this verification:
- The server calculates the expected token using the `socketId` and channel provided by the client, along with the `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`.
- The token sent by the client (`data.auth`) must match the calculated token for the subscription to be authorized.

### Conclusion

With this setup, **BunPulse** ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to channels, providing secure and reliable WebSocket communication.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to **BunPulse**! If you're interested in improving the project, fixing bugs, or adding new features, we encourage you to submit a pull request. Below are some areas where contributions would be especially valuable:

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Presence Channels**:
   - **Goal**: Implement support for presence channels, allowing clients to track and broadcast who is currently subscribed to a channel.
   - **What‚Äôs Needed**:
      - Add member tracking logic for `presence-` prefixed channels.
      - Broadcast `pusher_internal:member_added` and `pusher_internal:member_removed` events when members join/leave the channel.
      - Provide a list of current members when a client subscribes.

2. **Client-Side Events (`client-*`)**:
   - **Goal**: Enable clients to broadcast custom events (`client-*` prefixed) to other clients in the same private channel, while excluding the sender from receiving the event.
   - **What‚Äôs Needed**:
      - Implement handling of `client-*` events.
      - Ensure that the event is only broadcast to other clients, not the sender, and only works for private channels.

3. **Encrypted Channels**:
   - **Goal**: Add support for end-to-end encryption for `private-encrypted-` prefixed channels using AES-GCM.
   - **What‚Äôs Needed**:
      - Implement message encryption/decryption.
      - Manage key sharing securely between the server and clients.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - **Goal**: Improve the error reporting and handling for various edge cases, including invalid subscriptions, connection errors, and message handling failures.
   - **What‚Äôs Needed**:
      - Define and return more detailed error messages (`pusher:error` events).
      - Add more robust error handling mechanisms for connection issues and HTTP failures.

5. **Webhook Support**:
   - **Goal**: Add support for additional webhooks, such as when a channel is occupied or vacated.
   - **What‚Äôs Needed**:
      - Implement webhook notifications when key events occur (e.g., `channel_occupied`, `channel_vacated`, etc.).
