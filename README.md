<details>
  <summary>npm</summary>

```bash
npm install bun-pulse
```
</details> <details> <summary>pnpm</summary>

```bash
pnpm install bun-pulse
```
</details> <details> <summary>bun</summary>

```bash
bun add bun-pulse
```
</details>

Ensure you have **Bun** installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, follow the [Bun installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/install).

## Usage

Setting up **BunPulse** is quick and easy. Here's how you can start your own WebSocket server compatible with the Pusher protocol.

### Basic Example

```typescript
import { startBunPulse } from 'bun-pulse'

// Starts BunPulse on a custom port (default: 6001)
const server = startBunPulse({ port: 7000 })
```

then `bun run your-file.ts` to start the server.

### Handling Events and Forwarding Messages

> **Note**: Typically, you won‚Äôt need to manually publish events with `server.publish()` since your backend (e.g., Laravel Broadcasting) automatically handles broadcasting events to clients via **BunPulse**. However, if you want to extend functionality or handle specific events (e.g., custom WebSocket events), you can manually manage these cases using `server.publish()` or `server.on()`.

**BunPulse** automatically forwards events from your backend to all connected clients via WebSockets, using the Pusher protocol. It seamlessly handles event broadcasting, connection heartbeats, and secure HMAC-based authentication.

When your backend triggers an event (e.g., via Laravel Broadcasting), BunPulse ensures it is delivered to all clients subscribed to the relevant channel.

### Usage in Laravel Broadcasting

To integrate **BunPulse** with Laravel Broadcasting, configure the `broadcasting.php` file like this:

```php
'pusher' => [
	'driver'  => 'pusher',
	'key'     => env('PUSHER_APP_KEY'),
	'secret'  => env('PUSHER_APP_SECRET'),
	'app_id'  => env('PUSHER_APP_ID'),
	'options' => [
		'cluster'   => env('PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER'),
		'useTLS'    => true,
		'encrypted' => true,
		'host'      => env('WS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'), // bun-pulse host
		'port'      => env('WS_PORT', 6001),        // bun-pulse port
		'scheme'    => env('WS_SCHEME', 'http'),
	],
],
```

Alternatively, other methods to configure BunPulse can be found in the [Pusher documentation](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/channels_libraries/libraries/).

### Frontend: Using Pusher.js or Laravel Echo

On the frontend, you can use the `pusher-js` package, which works seamlessly with **BunPulse**, or you can use Laravel Echo if you prefer.

#### Example with Pusher.js

```javascript
import Pusher from 'pusher-js'

const pusher = new Pusher(process.env.PUSHER_APP_KEY, {
	cluster: process.env.PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
	wsHost: process.env.WS_HOST || '127.0.0.1',
	wsPort: process.env.WS_PORT || 6001,
	forceTLS: false,
	enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss'],
})

const channel = pusher.subscribe('my-channel')
channel.bind('my-event', (data) => {
	console.log(data.message)
})
```

## Configuration

You can customize **BunPulse** by passing configuration options when starting the server. These options include:

- `*`: All bun websocket server options are supported, see [bun docs](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#bun-serve) for more info.
- `port`: Specifies the port on which the WebSocket server listens (default: `6001`).
- `subscriptionVacancyUrl`: An optional URL to notify when a channel is vacated (i.e., no more subscribers).
- `heartbeatInterval`: The interval (in milliseconds) at which WebSocket heartbeat pings are sent to keep the connection alive (default: `25000`).
- `heartbeatTimeout`: The timeout (in milliseconds) after which an inactive WebSocket connection is closed (default: `60000`).

### Example with Custom Config:

```typescript
const server = startBunPulse({
	port: 7000,
	subscriptionVacancyUrl: 'https://myserver.com/api/subscriptions/webhook',
	heartbeatInterval: 20000, // Heartbeat every 20 seconds
	heartbeatTimeout: 50000 // Timeout after 50 seconds of inactivity
})
```

## Authentication

**BunPulse** uses HMAC SHA256 authentication to ensure secure WebSocket connections. When clients subscribe to a channel, they must provide a valid `auth` token, which is verified by the server to authenticate the connection.

### How Authentication Works

1. **Token Generation**:
    - On the client side, an `auth` token is generated by your backend using HMAC SHA256.
    - The token is created using the `socketId` (provided when the WebSocket connection is established) and the channel name that the client wants to subscribe to.
    - Your backend signs this data with the `PUSHER_APP_SECRET` and sends it back to the client.

2. **Token Verification**:
    - When a client attempts to subscribe to a channel, the `auth` token is sent to **BunPulse**.
    - **BunPulse** verifies the token by recalculating the HMAC using the `socketId` and channel, and comparing it with the token received from the client.
    - This ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to the channel.

### Setting up Pusher Authentication

To set up **BunPulse** with Pusher-style authentication, configure the following environment variables:

- `PUSHER_APP_KEY`: Your Pusher app key (used for client authentication).
- `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`: Your Pusher app secret (used for HMAC SHA256 signing).

Add these variables to your `.env` file or set them in your environment. Here's an example of the `.env` configuration:

```bash
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your-app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
```

### Example Backend Code for Generating the `auth` Token

In **BunPulse**, HMAC SHA256 is used to securely generate an `auth` token for client authentication. This ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to WebSocket channels. Below is an example of how you can generate the `auth` token in your backend using Bun's `CryptoHasher`.

> **Minimum requirement**: You need at least [Bun v1.1.30](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1.30#hmac-in-bun-cryptohasher) to use this feature.

```typescript
import { CryptoHasher } from 'bun'

export function generateHmacSHA256HexDigest(socketIdChannel: string, secret: string): string {
	// Initialize a new HMAC hasher with SHA256 algorithm and the provided secret
	const hmac = new CryptoHasher('sha256', secret)

	// Update the hasher with the socket ID and channel combined in the format: `${socketId}:${channel}`
	hmac.update(socketIdChannel)

	// Generate and return the HMAC digest as a hexadecimal string
	return hmac.digest('hex')
}

// Example usage:
const socketId = 'socket-id'
const channel = 'my-channel'
const authToken = generateHmacSHA256HexDigest(`${socketId}:${channel}`, process.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET)
```

### Explanation:

- **HMAC Generation**: This function uses Bun's `CryptoHasher` to generate an HMAC SHA256 digest from the combination of `socketId` and `channel`, signed with your `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`. The result is a hexadecimal-encoded `auth` token.

- **Example Usage**: In the example, we generate an `auth` token for the socket ID `'socket-id'` and the channel `'my-channel'` using the secret stored in the environment variable `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`.

By generating the `auth` token in this manner, you ensure secure communication between your backend and WebSocket clients.

### How BunPulse Verifies the Token

When the client subscribes to a channel, **BunPulse** uses the following logic to verify the `auth` token:

```typescript
function isAuthorized(socketId: string, data: WebSocketData): boolean {
	const expectedToken = generateHmacSHA256HexDigest(
		`${socketId}:${data.channel}`,
		String(import.meta.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET)
	)
	return data.auth === `${import.meta.env.PUSHER_APP_KEY}:${expectedToken}`
}
```

In this verification:
- The server calculates the expected token using the `socketId` and channel provided by the client, along with the `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`.
- The token sent by the client (`data.auth`) must match the calculated token for the subscription to be authorized.

### Conclusion

With this setup, **BunPulse** ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to channels, providing secure and reliable WebSocket communication.

## API Reference

### `startBunPulse(config?: BunPulseConfig)`

Starts the BunPulse WebSocket server.

**Arguments**:
- `config` (optional): An object containing configuration options such as:
    - `port`: Specifies the port on which the WebSocket server listens (default: `6001`).
    - `subscriptionVacancyUrl`: URL to notify when a channel is vacated.
    - `heartbeatInterval`: Interval for WebSocket heartbeats.
    - `heartbeatTimeout`: Timeout period for inactive WebSocket connections.

**Returns**: The WebSocket server instance.

---

Since **BunPulse** is primarily designed to forward messages from the backend using broadcasting tools (e.g., Laravel), you generally don't need to manually publish events or listen for specific WebSocket events. If you require manual publishing or event listening, here are the methods you can use:

### `server.publish(channel: string, event: PusherEvent)`

Publishes an event to a specific channel.

**Arguments**:
- `channel`: The name of the channel to which the event is published.
- `event`: An object containing the event name and data to be published.

**Returns**: `void`

> **Note**: In most cases, this is handled by your backend through broadcasting (e.g., Laravel Broadcasting) and is not required to be manually invoked.

### `server.on(event: string, callback: (ws, data) => void)`

Listens for specific WebSocket or Pusher events (e.g., `pusher:subscribe`).

**Arguments**:
- `event`: The name of the event (e.g., subscription or connection event).
- `callback`: The function to be executed when the event is triggered.

**Returns**: `void`

> **Note**: Event listening is generally handled through your frontend (e.g., Pusher.js or Laravel Echo) and doesn‚Äôt need to be manually configured in the server.
